Introduction
T
he rapid development in Information Technology (IT) has enabled business organizations to exploit IT as a tool to obtain competitive advantages. A key ingredient in the formula for success in this endeavour is for business professionals to apply Information Technology in management practices. Graduates armed with appropriate knowledge in Management and Information Technology disciplines is desired by the industry to meet the national requirement. The launch of a new Special degree programme named B.Sc. in Business Administration (Information Systems) (Special) by the Faculty of Management Studies and Commerce, University of Sri Jayewardenepura in 2001 was aimed to meet this demand. This programme was the first of its kind in Sri Lanka that combined Management and Information Technology disciplines for students in the Advanced Level commerce stream. The Department of Information Technology and Decision Sciences was established in the Faculty to provide the organizational infrastructure for the degree programme.
In December 2007, the Department was split into two separate departments – namely Information Technology and Decision Sciences to facilitate the development of the separate disciplines. Subsequently, the existing degree programme offered by the Department of Information Technology was renamed as B.Sc. in Business Information Systems (Special) Degree. The renaming of the degree was carried out to better reflect the composition of the course structure and to address the evolving market needs.

Coastal Clean-Up 2024
The Department of Information Technology conducted a coastal clean-up at Wellawatte Beach as part of its community service initiatives on the 5th of October 2024. The project was organized in collaboration with the Students’ Association of Information Technology and Parley Sri Lanka. Over 120 volunteers, including department undergraduates and academic staff, participated in the event. Prof. Lasith Gunawardena, Mr. Devaka Punchihewa, Mr. Shantha Puhulwella, Mr. Prabhasara Athurupane, Mr. Kavinga Elamulla, Ms. Zikra Fazil, Ms. Upeksha Samarasinghe, and Mr. Thanuja Wickramanayaka from the Academic Staff joined the session. Special thanks to Ms. Semini Hasanthi for coordinating the project on behalf of Parley Sri Lanka. By the end of the project, more than 450 kg of plastic, polythene, glass, and other waste had been collected.
These pollutants entering the ocean originate from human activities not only along the coast but also further inland. No matter where we live—whether near the coast or far from it—we all contribute to the issue of ocean pollution and can also be part of the solution. Through this project, we aimed to help keep the oceans clean and raise awareness about ways to combat pollution, regardless of location. As a department, we intend to carry this initiative forward with these objectives in mind.

Coastal Clean-Up 2024
The Department of Information Technology conducted a coastal clean-up at Wellawatte Beach as part of its community service initiatives on the 5th of October 2024. The project was organized in collaboration with the Students’ Association of Information Technology and Parley Sri Lanka. Over 120 volunteers, including department undergraduates and academic staff, participated in the event. Prof. Lasith Gunawardena, Mr. Devaka Punchihewa, Mr. Shantha Puhulwella, Mr. Prabhasara Athurupane, Mr. Kavinga Elamulla, Ms. Zikra Fazil, Ms. Upeksha Samarasinghe, and Mr. Thanuja Wickramanayaka from the Academic Staff joined the session. Special thanks to Ms. Semini Hasanthi for coordinating the project on behalf of Parley Sri Lanka. By the end of the project, more than 450 kg of plastic, polythene, glass, and other waste had been collected.
These pollutants entering the ocean originate from human activities not only along the coast but also further inland. No matter where we live—whether near the coast or far from it—we all contribute to the issue of ocean pollution and can also be part of the solution. Through this project, we aimed to help keep the oceans clean and raise awareness about ways to combat pollution, regardless of location. As a department, we intend to carry this initiative forward with these objectives in mind.

Introduction
T
he rapid development in Information Technology (IT) has enabled business organizations to exploit IT as a tool to obtain competitive advantages. A key ingredient in the formula for success in this endeavour is for business professionals to apply Information Technology in management practices. Graduates armed with appropriate knowledge in Management and Information Technology disciplines is desired by the industry to meet the national requirement. The launch of a new Special degree programme named B.Sc. in Business Administration (Information Systems) (Special) by the Faculty of Management Studies and Commerce, University of Sri Jayewardenepura in 2001 was aimed to meet this demand. This programme was the first of its kind in Sri Lanka that combined Management and Information Technology disciplines for students in the Advanced Level commerce stream. The Department of Information Technology and Decision Sciences was established in the Faculty to provide the organizational infrastructure for the degree programme.
In December 2007, the Department was split into two separate departments – namely Information Technology and Decision Sciences to facilitate the development of the separate disciplines. Subsequently, the existing degree programme offered by the Department of Information Technology was renamed as B.Sc. in Business Information Systems (Special) Degree. The renaming of the degree was carried out to better reflect the composition of the course structure and to address the evolving market needs.

Introduction
T
he rapid development in Information Technology (IT) has enabled business organizations to exploit IT as a tool to obtain competitive advantages. A key ingredient in the formula for success in this endeavour is for business professionals to apply Information Technology in management practices. Graduates armed with appropriate knowledge in Management and Information Technology disciplines is desired by the industry to meet the national requirement. The launch of a new Special degree programme named B.Sc. in Business Administration (Information Systems) (Special) by the Faculty of Management Studies and Commerce, University of Sri Jayewardenepura in 2001 was aimed to meet this demand. This programme was the first of its kind in Sri Lanka that combined Management and Information Technology disciplines for students in the Advanced Level commerce stream. The Department of Information Technology and Decision Sciences was established in the Faculty to provide the organizational infrastructure for the degree programme.
In December 2007, the Department was split into two separate departments – namely Information Technology and Decision Sciences to facilitate the development of the separate disciplines. Subsequently, the existing degree programme offered by the Department of Information Technology was renamed as B.Sc. in Business Information Systems (Special) Degree. The renaming of the degree was carried out to better reflect the composition of the course structure and to address the evolving market needs.

Introduction
T
he rapid development in Information Technology (IT) has enabled business organizations to exploit IT as a tool to obtain competitive advantages. A key ingredient in the formula for success in this endeavour is for business professionals to apply Information Technology in management practices. Graduates armed with appropriate knowledge in Management and Information Technology disciplines is desired by the industry to meet the national requirement. The launch of a new Special degree programme named B.Sc. in Business Administration (Information Systems) (Special) by the Faculty of Management Studies and Commerce, University of Sri Jayewardenepura in 2001 was aimed to meet this demand. This programme was the first of its kind in Sri Lanka that combined Management and Information Technology disciplines for students in the Advanced Level commerce stream. The Department of Information Technology and Decision Sciences was established in the Faculty to provide the organizational infrastructure for the degree programme.
In December 2007, the Department was split into two separate departments – namely Information Technology and Decision Sciences to facilitate the development of the separate disciplines. Subsequently, the existing degree programme offered by the Department of Information Technology was renamed as B.Sc. in Business Information Systems (Special) Degree. The renaming of the degree was carried out to better reflect the composition of the course structure and to address the evolving market needs.
